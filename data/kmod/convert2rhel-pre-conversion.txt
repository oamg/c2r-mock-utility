(OVERRIDABLE) ENSURE_KERNEL_MODULES_COMPATIBILITY::UNSUPPORTED_KERNEL_MODULES - Unsupported kernel modules
Description: Unsupported kernel modules were found
Diagnosis: The following loaded kernel modules are not available in RHEL:
/lib/modules/3.10.0-1160.114.2.el7.x86_64/kernel/drivers/net/bonding/custom_module_location/bonding.ko.xz

Remediations: Ensure you have updated the kernel to the latest available version and rebooted the system.
If this message persists, you can prevent the modules from loading by following https://access.redhat.com/solutions/41278 and rerun convert2rhel.
Keeping them loaded could cause the system to malfunction after the conversion as they might not work properly with the RHEL kernel.
To circumvent this check and accept the risk you can set environment variable 'CONVERT2RHEL_ALLOW_UNAVAILABLE_KMODS=1'.
